			I have known Miss Chioma since her undergraduate days at the University of Nigeria Nsukka where she was admitted to study Electronic Engineering. I thought her Engineering Mathematics and she always show high understanding of the underlying concepts and a continuous interest in learning new topics.

Miss Chioma  is highly motivated academically. She is hardworking and usually committed to her work. The quality of her previous work is very good and she has very good promise of future productive academic work. She is very creative and has tremendous capacity for persistent and independent research activities. She relates well with others and performs excellently well in team work. 

As a person, Miss Chioma is a very unassuming, honest and polite and she is totally amenable to law and order. She is mentally, emotionally and physically very stable.
